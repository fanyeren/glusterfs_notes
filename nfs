The Gluster Native Client is a POSIX conformant, FUSE-based client running in user space.
Gluster Native Client is the recommended method for accessing volumes when high concurrency
and high write performance is required. 
When reading many small files, the native NFS client will perform better. 



Gluster offers multiple ways for users to access volumes in a Gluster storage cluster:

Gluster Native Client - This method provides high concurrency, performance and transparent failover in GNU/Linux clients.
The Gluster Native Client is POSIX conformant. For accessing volumes using gluster native protocol, you need to install
gluster native client. For more information, see Gluster Native Client.


NFS - This method provides access to gluster volumes with NFS v3. Extensive testing has be done on GNU/Linux clients
and NFS implementation in other operating system, such as FreeBSD, and Mac OS X, as well as Windows 7 (Professional
and Up), Windows Server 2003, and others, may work with gluster NFS server implementation. You must install nfs-common
package on both servers and clients (only for Debian-based) distribution. For more information, see NFS

# mount -t nfs server1:7997:/test-volume /mnt/glusterfs


CIFS - This method provides access to volumes when using Microsoft Windows as well as SAMBA clients. For this access
method, Samba packages need to be present on the client side. For more information, see CIFS.
